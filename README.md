This is some experimental Typst file by me. Maybe it will become a little library.
I want to implement:

- [x] Basic theorem environments like LaTeX.
- [ ] Commutative diagrams like Tikzcd.
- [ ] Fonts configuration as in xeCJK. (Now partially implemented)
- [ ] Maybe more others?

Problems with Typst:
- [ ] Cannot set the font according to the unicode class or the range of characters.
- [ ] I can't find a similar symbol as \varinjlim in LaTeX.
- [ ] I can't update a counter when another counter (like header) steps.
